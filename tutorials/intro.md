## Working with MongoDB Data

Working with MongoDB can be challenging due to the nature of NoSQL database, which is highly optimized for capturing the data but not for querying or analyzing the data. Unlike relational database or tabular data, the data is often hierarchical and nested and contains the array type of data. With Exploratory, not only can you extract the data from MongoDB quickly, but also you can make such non-tidy (not tabular / not normalized) data to tidy format based on your needs and apply statistical analysis easily. This tutorial walk you through the steps.
