For Business and Organizations

Legal entities, including companies and organizations (both for-profit and non-profit), requiring the software for general commercial use qualify for the Commercial Toolbox Subscription plans. A legal entity may use the software under Commercial Toolbox Subscription on any computer, operating system, and by any developer within a legal entity, provided that the total number of concurrent users never exceeds the number of subscriptions purchased by that legal entity.

For Individual Developers

If you, as an individual, are purchasing Toolbox Subscription using your own funds, then the Personal Toolbox Subscription plans are right for you.

Personal Toolbox Subscriptions cannot be purchased by companies in any way or form, nor can a company reimburse an individual for a subscription he/she purchased. However, an individual may use Personal Toolbox Subscription that he/she privately purchased on any hardware, including company hardware.

For Education and Open Source

Students, teachers, academic institutions and non-commercial open source software projects qualify for the 1-year complimentary subscriptions allowing them to use the fully-functional versions of software for non-commercial purposes. For the complimentary subscription terms, check the subscription comparison matrix.
