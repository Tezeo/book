## R 1.9.0

Released on 8/16/2016

### New Features

- Pivot Table - You can now use Pivot Table to summarize data quickly and spot patterns and trends by using color. Here is a [blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-pivot-table-1c9c949fd2d6#.z8dwtwbx9) introducing Pivot Table.

### Enhancements

- Google Analytics - Goal Data Support - Now you can bring Goals related data by selecting the related dimensions and measures. This is useful to understand and analyze 'conversion funnel'. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/analyzing-user-conversion-funnel-with-google-analytics-data-ddeed14ce26f#.y5buhtbz0)

## R 1.8.0

Released on 7/29/2016

### New Features

### Enhancements

- do_ngram function now takes sentence id and document id, both of which are always generated by do_tfidf function. This means you don't need to run 'group_by' before building the ngram step. Also, it produces the ngram text in columns so you will need to use 'gather' command to make them into a single column. [Detail](https://exploratory.io/reference/#do_ngram)
- do_tfidf function now supports 'norm' argument that can be used to normalize the TF-IDF values. The default is L2. [Detail](https://exploratory.io/reference/#do_tfidf)

## R 1.7.0

Released on 7/18/2016

### New Features

- Chart sharing on Medium - You can copy and paste an URL of the shared chart into Medium blog post to embed an interactive chart.
- Remote database connection - You can create 'connections', which has a set of the connection parameters, for your databases on the project list page and use them for multiple data frames. You no longer need to type the databases information for every single data frame!
- Custom R functions and variables with R Script - You can register your own R scripts where you can define your R functions and attach them to your projects so that you can call the functions when you work with data. This can be used for defining your own variables as well.
- Selective R package loading per project - You can select which R packages to load at the project level.

- Encoding support for Web Scraping - It will automatically detect an appropriate encoding, but this is heuristic, you can always override this by selecting the right one from the list.
- Select R packages loading - You can select which R packages to load per project now.

### Bug fixes



## R 1.6.1

Released on 7/5/2016

### Enhancements

- Syntax suggestion supports new functions from dplyr 0.5 now.

### Bug fixes

- libPaths command in the generated R script is correctly escaped for Windows.
- User added R packages will be added into the generated R script with library command.

## R 1.6.0

Released on 7/1/2016

### New Features

- Data Share - Now you can publish and share your data at any step of the data transformation pipeline (right hand side) with a click of a button through Exploratory.io. The published data can be downloaded and imported into your project along with the data transformation steps so that others can understand how the data was prepared, can reproduce the data with all the steps, and can modify or add their own steps. This would make it easier for you to collaborate with your team members through data.  

- New remote data support - Redshift, PostgreSQL - Now you can write SQL queries to extract data from these two data sources, much like existing MySQL / MongoDB options.

- Custom R package installation - Finally, you can install your preferred R packages inside Exploratory Desktop. In this release, the installed packages will be automatically loaded when you open the projects. In future release. you will be able to control this at each project level. Also, only CRAN repository is supported for this release, but Github support will be coming shortly.


### Enhancements

- 'get_sentiment' function has been refactored so that now it can return the sentiment for sentences, not just per word. The old version of 'get_sentiment' functionality is now provided through 'word_to_sentiment' function. The new 'get_sentiment' function uses [sentimentr](https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr) package internally, which provides a super fast sentiment scoring capability at the sentence level.

- tidyr is upgraded to v0.5.1. The biggest new addition with this upgrade is 'separate_rows' function, which would separate delimited words into rows. [Detail](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr/releases)

- dplyr is upgraded to v0.5.0. There are many enhancements and new functions with this release. Here's the [detail](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/releases). Note that 'distinct' function has been updated to keep only the specified columns and this might break your transformation steps. You can bring those dropped columns back with '.keep_all=TRUE' argument. Also, now column names with multibyte characters is supported in 'mutate' command. Great news for users in East Asia!

- Reproducible! with R script generation - Now the generated R script contains all the core R packages with 'library' commands and '.libPaths' command to set the library path to Exploratory repository. This will make it a lot easier to reproduce the transformation steps outside of Exploratory Desktop, such as R console, RStudio, etc.


### Bug fixes

- Chart - Now you can open Chart view even when an referenced column is not available after some updates in the previous steps.
- Column names with Multibyte characters can be processed correctly with mutate / summarize commands now.
- Now it shows up to 300 columns and 1000 rows in Table view correctly even when there are a lot more columns in the data frame.

## R 1.5.2

Released on 6/20/2016

### Enhancements

- Updated all the machine learning functions spec, including text mining, statistical functions, to make them consistent.

### Bug fixes

- It was not showing an appropriate errors in Table / Chart views when invalid functions are used in the steps.
- 'build_kmeans.kv' command was not augmenting the cluster IDs appropriately on top of the original data.

## R 1.5.1

## R 1.5.0

Released on 6/16/2016

### New Features

- Chart Sharing and Embedding - Now you can publish charts directly from inside the data frame without creating a note. The hosted chart will have an unique URL and can be shared with the URL or embedded into your web pages or blog (e.g. Wordpress) with the automatically generated code. Also, you can share the chart URL on other mediums like Twitter, Facebook, Slack, etc, and the chart images will be automatically shown up. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-interactive-chart-sharing-and-embedding-4cfb801c063e#.7it0wsko0)
- Branch - You can create one or more branches inside the data frame to quickly experiment different analysis paths. All the branches inside a single data frame can share the common data transformation and analysis path in a main branch while they can have their own different analysis paths. Being able to run multiple experiments by creating multiple branches inside the data frames will enhance the flexibility and efficiency of your exploratory data analysis. Data dependency among the branches and among the transformation steps are managed by Exploratory's DAG engine to keep all the data cache intact. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-branch-for-running-multiple-experiments-quickly-84352ce245b6#.150aissqr)
- Text Analytics - We have added a set of the text mining related functions that are designed to work better with 'tidy' data form. By employing these functions, you can quickly tokenize text, remove stop words, stem words, construct n-grams, calculate TF-IDF and document similarity, reduce dimensions with SVD, and building document clustering models.
- Added [Short Cut Keys](http://docs.exploratory.io/shortcut.html) for the command input.

### Enhancements

- Chart: Support custom text entry for Title, X-Axis, and Y-Axis.
- Windows: you can now scroll Table view vertically and horizontally by using the scroll bar as well as using touch pad.
- Added %nin% (Not IN) operator so that you can use it in a condition (e.g. filter).

## R 1.4.2

Released on 5/26/2016

### New Features

- Text data wrangling with the tidytext package, which makes it easy to work with text data in a tidy format.

  With this tidytext package introduction, we are introducing unnest_tokens and pair_counts functions from the tidytext package as data frame level functions and get_sentiment and get_stopwords functions from the exploratory package as mutate / filter level functions.

This makes it possible to call broom's tidy functions to access the models' statistical summary information or augment their scored data with the original data columns.

### Enhancements
