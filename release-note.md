## R 1.4.1

Released on 5/16/2016

### New Features

- Introducing the broom package's tidy / glance / augment functions as data wrangling grammar
- Support 'model' and 'source data' type columns so that you can build models with functions like do_lm, do_glm, do_kmeans, and store them inside the data frame. This makes it possible to call broom's tidy functions to access the models' statistical summary information or augment their scored data with the original data columns.

### Enhancements

- Installer: It checks if Git is installed under /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin. Unless it's older than 2.0 it won't try to install or upgrade. Please check FAQ page for the detail on the version check logic and requirements for both R and Git.

- Chart: Heatmap / Contour - introducing an option to choose whether NA as NA or zero.
- Chart: You can add margin (space) at X-axis and Y-axis so that text label can be showing up better.
- Improvements for model building and inspection for Linear Regression (lm), K-means clustering (kmeans), and Generalized Linear Regression (glm).
- Table: You can select # of rows to display in the table. The options are 200 (default), 500, 1000.
- Excel Data: It shows a dropdown list so that you can select a sheet name instead of needing to type the name.
