# Pivot Table

Pivot Table makes it super easy to not only summarize (aggregate) data but also spot outliers or patterns quickly by using color. And, just like any other visualization (chart) types you can share it with reproducible data preparation steps simply by clicking a button and start having a conversation around the data.

We have written a blog post that walk you through what you can do with Pivot Table and how.
