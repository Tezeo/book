## Column Assignments

* X-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at X-Axis. If it's a Date / Time column assigned, you can select the aggregation level such as `Month`, `Week`, `Day`, etc. If you assign a Number column, you can choose either `As Number` to treat values as continuous values or `As Text` to treat values as categorical values.  
* Y-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at Y-Axis. You can include/exclude the outlier by the `Include Outlier` checkbox.
* Color - Take a look at [Color](color.md) section for more details.
* Repeat By - You can assign a column to repeat the chart for each of its values. Take a look at [Small Multiple](small-multiple.md) section for more details.
