## Column Assignments

* X-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at X-Axis. If it is a date / time column assigned, the axis will be automatically in time series. If it is a number based column, the axis will be for the continuous values. If it is a text based column, the axis will be for discrete values. 

* Y-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at Y-Axis. The assigned column is handled in the same way as X-Axis.  

* Z-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at Z-Axis. By assigning Z-Axis, the chart becomes 3D Scatter chart. The assigned column is handled in the same way as X-Axis. Note Z-Axis is disabled on Windows platform because 3D Scatter chart is currently not supported on Windows.
